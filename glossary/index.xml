Here are the ones you&amp;rsquo;re most likely to encounter.
Name This is not actually a component, but it lives at the top of the inspector panel, above all the components. Here you can give your object a meaningful name as well as attach a tag, which is useful for identifying things during collisions.
Transform All GameObjects have a transform component, which manages the position, rotation and scale of the object in the scene.</description></item><item><title>coordinates</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10b/glossary/coordinates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10b/glossary/coordinates/</guid><description>3D coordinate systems can be either left- or right-handed. In most of the maths and physics world, we us a right-handed system, but in Unity we use a left-handed one. But what does that mean?
If you hold your left hand with your thumb pointing to the right (the x-axis) and your index finger pointing up (the y-axis), when you extend your middle finger it will point away from you. But if you do the same with your right hand, facing your thumb to the right and your index finger up, your middle finger will extend toward you.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchy</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10b/glossary/hierarchy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10b/glossary/hierarchy/</guid><description/></item><item><title>types</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10b/glossary/types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10b/glossary/types/</guid><description>Kind of information Name Main type Other types whole numbers integer int uint, sbyte, byte, short, ushort, long, ulong decimals in scientific notation floating point number double float true/false boolean bool text string string individual letters, digits character char bool Boolean bool Integer Integers are whole numbers: positive, negative or zero.

Note that transform always has three dimensions, even when working in a 2D project.
If you want to rotate an object in a 2D project, you probably want to rotate about the z-axis! Sprite Renderer Sprite renderers draw (render) 2D images (sprites).</description></item></channel></rss>
