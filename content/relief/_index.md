As promised, I'm going to get you to follow through [this tutorial]({{< ref "/basics/endlessBackground" >}}) to build an infinitely scrolling background using a tileable background image. If you want to grab one quickly, [grab one of these](https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit8/gameDesign/02basics/assetsPlatform/backgrounds/) from the Year 8 site.

The code is also included on that page, in case you need to debug anything afterwards. Help each other as you need!
