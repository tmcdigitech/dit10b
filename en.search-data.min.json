Darts During a game of darts, the highest score that can be achieved in a single turn is 180. The lowest is 0. Write a program that will allow a dart player to enter their score. The program should congratulate the player if their score was over 100. If the player scores less than 10 they should be told that some practice is required.

Charity Collection Three friends have been collecting money for charity. A local company has offered to double the amount of money they collect if they raise over $1000. Write a program that allows the friends to enter their individual amounts. The program should then add the three amounts and store the total. If the total is greater or equal to $1000 the total should be doubled. Finally the total should be displayed. Enter the first amount raised. \u0026gt; 398 Enter the second amount raised. \u0026gt; 193 Enter the third amount raised. \u0026gt; 478 A total of $1069 was raised. This will be doubled to $2138. 12. Solid, Liquid, Gas At normal atmospheric pressure, water is a solid at or below 0°C, a gas above 100°C, and a liquid in the middle.

Cricket over In cricket a bowler bowls 6 balls at a time. This is called an over. Each ball bowled may be hit by the batter who may score some runs. Write a program that allows the runs from an over to be entered (for example: 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 6). The total scored in that over should then be displayed. Please enter the runs for each ball: \u0026gt; 0 \u0026gt; 2 \u0026gt; 0 \u0026gt; 0 \u0026gt; 4 \u0026gt; 6 This over\u0026#39;s score was 12. 15.

Adapt program 11 to repeatedly ask for the next amount of money raised. If the user types a number, that number is added to the total and the program asks again. If the user just presses Enter, with nothing else, the program stops asking and displays the total raised, including the doubled value if appropriate. Enter the total raised by each person: \u0026gt; 238 \u0026gt; 624 \u0026gt; 546 \u0026gt; 333 \u0026gt; 651 \u0026gt; 174 \u0026gt; A total of $2566 was raised. This will be increased to $4566. 17. Password The program should give the user an error message if they enter the wrong password. A message “Entry gained!” should be displayed when the password is entered correctly. Please enter the password. \u0026gt; snool Sorry, Incorrect! Try again. Please enter the password. \u0026gt; giraffe Sorry, Incorrect! Try again. Please enter the password. \u0026gt; sesame Entry gained! 18. No more presents You have money to spend on your birthday. Write a program that will ask you what you have to spend, and then to enter the price of each present you want until your total reaches or is over the amount you started with. The program should produce the output shown. How much money did you get? \u0026gt; 200 You have $200. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 35 You have $165. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 100 You have $65. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 50 You have $15. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 45 You have overspent! You can\u0026#39;t afford the $45 item. How much money did you get? \u0026gt; 48 You have $48. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 48 You have spent all $48! 19. Guess the number A game is created where a user is required to guess an unknown number between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Each time the user guesses the program informs them if their guess is too high, too low or correct. The guessing game only finishes when the user’s guess matches the unknown number. I\u0026#39;m thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Which number do you think it is? 45 Your guess is too low. Try again. 86 Your guess is too high. Try again. 67 Your guess is too high. Try again. 50 Your guess is too low. Try again. 54 Your guess is too high. Try again. 52 Correct! I was thinking of 52. 20.
